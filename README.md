# Used Car Price Prediction
This project predicts the price of a car by building a model using previous data. The used cars dataset is obtained from Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes). Different regressor modelling techniques (i.e. Linear Regressor, Decision Tree, Multilayer Perceptrons and Random Forest) are applied and their variances and accuracies are computed. The Random Forest Regressor gave the best results showing the variance of 96% and an accuracy of 89%.

The presentation slides and dataset is also provided along with the code
